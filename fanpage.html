    </h2>
    <p>
            The life of Frederick Bulsara began on the East African island of Zanzibar 
            on September 5, 1946.<br /> 25 years later in London under the name of Freddie 
            Mercury he was fronting the now legendary rock group named Queen.<br />
            <br />
            The son of Bomi and Jer Bulsara, Freddie spent the bulk of his childhood in India where he attended St. Peter’s boarding school.
            <br />He began taking piano lessons at the age of seven. No one could foresee where a love of music would take him.   <br />
            <br />
            The rest is rock history. EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their debut album ‘Queen’ was released    <br />and hailed as one of the most exciting developments ever in rock music.
